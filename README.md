# Push_swap Project

## Introduction

The Push_swap project involves sorting data on a stack using a limited set of instructions and the lowest possible number of actions. The program is executed as follows: `./push_swap [list of integers]`. The output will be the list of instructions that sort the integers.

## Mandatory Part

- Program name: push_swap
- Turn in files: Makefile, *.h, *.c
- Makefile: NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
- Arguments: A list of integers
- External functions: write, malloc, free, exit, all functions of the math library (-lm compiler option, man man 3 math), ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded
- Libft authorized: Yes

Your project must comply with the following rules:

- You have 2 stacks named a and b.
- At the beginning:
  - The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.
  - The stack b is empty.
- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the following operations at your disposal:
  - sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
  - sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
  - ss: sa and sb at the same time.
  - pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
  - pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
  - ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
  - rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
  - rr: ra and rb at the same time.
  - rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
  - rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
  - rrr: rra and rrb at the same time.

## Bonus Part

This project leaves little room for adding extra features due to its simplicity. However, how about creating your own checker?

Thanks to the checker program, you will be able to check whether the list of instructions generated by the push_swap program actually sorts the stack properly.

- Program name: checker
- Turn in files: *.h, *.c
- Makefile: bonus
- Arguments: stack a: A list of integers
- External functions: read, write, malloc, free, exit, ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded
- Libft authorized: Yes
- Description: Execute the sorting instructions

The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is PERFECT. Perfect means the mandatory part has been integrally done and works without malfunctioning. If you have not passed ALL the mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not be evaluated at all.
